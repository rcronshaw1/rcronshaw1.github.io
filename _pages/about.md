Bio
------

Robert Cronshaw is an academic radiologist, hononary clinical lecturer and PhD candidate with the [University of Edinburgh's clinical academic track (ECAT) programme](https://medicine-vet-medicine.ed.ac.uk/our-research/cmvm-research-support/translation-commercialisation/edinburgh-clinical-academic-track/ecat-i). He received a first class intercalated MSci (2016) in Biochemistry as well as his undergraduate medical degree from the University of Cambridge. He has since completed foundation training in Glasgow, and is now an honorary radiology registrar in Edinburgh. 

Research interests include modelling risk and pre-test probability using multimodal approaches, use of large scale real world imaging datasets, medical generative AI, and realistic radiology. He believes AI should has the potential to transform healthcare, but only if it focusses on creating bespoke solutions to genuine clinical problems, rather than fitting the problem to the solution.
